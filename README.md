# OCC API UTILS

## Oracle Commerce Cloud

### Why Use This Tool?
As a developer, it's easy to interact with REST APIs using tools like Postman, SoapUI, Swagger, and others. However, the same may not be the case for everyone. That's why we built a UI-based API tool that simplifies interactions with APIs. All you need to do is click a few buttons and provide some inputs.

### What Does This Tool Do?
This tool is designed to facilitate interactions with Oracle Commerce Cloud APIs.

### How It Works
To begin, this tool is built using the popular Next.js framework, which is based on the React library. To run this app on your local system, ensure you have the following software installed:

1. Node.js (LTS version)
2. Git (to clone this repository to your local system)
3. Visual Studio Code (optional but preferred for code editing)

Once you've cloned this repository to your local system using Git, open the directory where the app is located. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you'll find a terminal option in the top navigation bar. Click on it to open a terminal.

Now it's time to run a set of commands in the terminal to start this app. Please follow the listed commands in the specified order:

```bash
npm install -g yarn   # Install the Yarn package globally.
yarn install          # Install all required node modules.
yarn dev              # Start the development server.
```

Additinal commands
```bash
yarn build  # Use this command to create a production build.
yarn start  # If you need to serve the build, use this command.
```
